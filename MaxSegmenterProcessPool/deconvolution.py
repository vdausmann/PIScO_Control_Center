def run_deconvolution(input: Queue, output: Queue, n_imgs: int, batch_size: int = 4):
    """
    Perform deconvolution on a series of images using a batch processing approach.

    This function reads cleaned images from an input queue, processes them in batches,
    and performs deconvolution using a pre-trained model. The results are placed in
    an output queue. It ensures that images are only processed if their standard
    deviation is above a threshold, indicating that they are not blank or corrupt.

    Args:
        input (Queue): A queue containing tuples of corrected images, cleaned images,
                       their statistical mean and standard deviation, and filenames.
        output (Queue): A queue to store the deconvolved images along with their
                        corrected versions and metadata.
        n_imgs (int): The total number of images to process.
        batch_size (int, optional): The number of images to process in a single batch.
                                    Default is 4.

    Notes:
        - The function assumes that the images are already preprocessed and ready
          for deconvolution.
        - It uses PyTorch to perform the deconvolution on GPU ('cuda').
        - Each image's mean and standard deviation are checked to ensure they
          meet the criteria for processing.
        - The function uses a pre-trained model (assumed to be defined elsewhere)
          for the actual deconvolution process.
