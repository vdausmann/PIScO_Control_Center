class ProcessPool:
    """
    A simple process pool for executing tasks in parallel using multiple processes.

    This class manages a pool of worker processes that can execute a given function
    on tasks fetched from a queue. It allows control over task addition, starting
    and stopping of processes, and checking if the pool is still running.

    Attributes:
        func (callable): The function to be executed by each worker process on the tasks.
        tasks (Queue): A queue holding tasks to be processed by the workers.
        running (multiprocessing.Value): A shared value indicating whether the pool is active.
        processes (list): A list of worker processes managed by the pool.

    Methods:
        add_task(task): Adds a task to the task queue.
        worker(index, name): The worker process function that processes tasks.
        start(n_processes, name): Starts the specified number of worker processes.
        stop(slow): Stops the worker processes either gracefully or immediately.
        is_running(): Checks if any worker processes are still running.
